Ques: Define Mean.
Ans: Average of all values
     Formula: mean = (sum of values) / n
Ques: Define Median.
Ans: Middle value after sorting.
     - If even count: median = avg of 2 middle values.

Ques: Defin Mode.
Ans: - Value that appears the most times.

Ques: Define Variance.
Ans: - Measures spread from mean.
     - Formula: variance = Σ(x - mean)² / n

Ques: Define standarrd deviation. 
Asn: - Square root of variance.
     - SD = sqrt(variance)
     - Higher SD → more spread, Lower SD → less spread

Ques: explain PMF.
Ans: PMF:
Used for discrete random variables.
Gives probability of each specific value.

Properties:
- P(X = x) ≥ 0
- Σ P(X = x) = 1


Ques: Explain PDF.
Ans: PDF:
Used for continuous random variables.
Gives probability *density*, not probability.

Properties:
- PDF ≥ 0
- Total area under the curve = 1
- Actual probability = area under the curve
  P(a ≤ X ≤ b) = ∫ f(x) dx from a to b

Ques: Expalin CDF.
Ans: CDF:
Gives probability that the random variable is less than or equal to a value.

Formula:
CDF(x) = P(X ≤ x)

For Discrete:
CDF(x) = Σ P(X = k) for k ≤ x

For Continuous:
CDF(x) = ∫ f(t) dt from -∞ to x
